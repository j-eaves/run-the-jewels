	<p>Climate Change The Jewels – Harvey, Jose, Irma, and Maria—just to name a few. Hurricanes are devastating the country and the world. But as the United States floods and people lose their lives and livelihoods, earthquakes, fires other natural disasters go unnoticed around the globe. With this level of devastation now in humanity’s backyard—why is preserving and protecting our natural resources still a partisan issue? How has “climate change” become a political buzzword? With things only poised to get worse, Mike and El-P set out to sift through the lies, the politics and the science of a planet that changing around us—and shed light on just what our role in it is. And if climate change is difficult to talk about, it’s a fuck-ton harder to do anything about. But Run the Jewels pay visits to those pioneers and heroes on the front lines, maybe saving us from ourselves. </p>
