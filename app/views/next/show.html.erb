But when does modern science, really go full sci-fi. Mike and El-P meet with the most cutting scientists and engineers to see what lies around the corner for humanity. Artificial intelligences are already teaching themselves their own languages. Doctors can already select traits for your future babies. Is technology blasting past our human ability to measure it against ethics and morals? How long will it be until, like last yearâ€™s iPhone, humans are obsolete?</p>
